# TCP Benchmarks 

This directory provides wrappers to run simple network benchmarks, using the iperf3 and netperf tools. iperf3 is used as a throughput-intensive application, and network as a latency-sensitive application.

+ iperf3 can be downloaded from: https://github.com/esnet/iperf
+ netperf can be downloaded from: https://github.com/HewlettPackard/netperf
